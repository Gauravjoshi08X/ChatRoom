<H1>Project Name: LocalChat</H1>

<H2>Problem Statement</H2>

Sometimes you just want to chat casually with people around you whether you're bored in class, killing time at a coffee shop, or just curious what people nearby are talking about. But there's no fun, low-stakes way to do this without the commitment of social media profiles or the awkwardness of approaching strangers. We wanted to create a space for spontaneous,anonymous conversations with people in your area.

<H2>Solution</H2>

LocalChat is a no-strings-attached chat app where you can instantly talk to people within 5km of you. Close enough that you might actually share the same experiences, weather, local events, or even meet up if the vibe is right. Just open the site and you're in. You can jump into existing rooms or create your own. Want to find something specific? Use keywords as an optional filter to discover rooms your friends made, or skip it entirely and just browse what's happening nearby. It's designed to be fun, casual, and completely anonymous.
